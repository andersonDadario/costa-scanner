# Operations after a server has been discovered
# Custom Operations can be set in this configuration file
# Let's suppose that we want to run the "ping" scanner
# First of all, it must be installed (check Dockerfile)
# After that, you can set a new operation just like below
#
# [
#   {
#    "name":"StartPing",
#    "operation":"StartScanner",
#    "data":
#      {
#         "scanner":"ping",
#         "params":["-c","1","%server%"]
#      }
#    }
# ]
#
# It will execute: $ ping -c 1 <server>
#
# After that, make sure to set it as an operation to be executed
